# Roadmap

This roadmap represents some of priorities for us over the next couple months. Issues or pull requests will be opened to discuss each of these items as they progress.

The high-priority features for upcoming releases are:
- Auto project generation with simple scripts

## 1. Return the project to a “maintained” status

- [] Return the project to a “maintained” status by creating a core team, documenting all policies and processes, reviewing stale Issues and Pull Requests, and establishing a regular release cadence.

## 2. Modernize the community

- [] Modernize the community by consolidating officially supported repositories into one GitHub organization, creating a place for users to get support and contributors to collaborate, improving contributor experience, and establishing this process for evolving going forward.
