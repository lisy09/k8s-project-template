# Feature name

> A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation

> Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to implement, show how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help developers create better workflows. Include any links to Issues or Pull Requests where the need for this feature came up.

## Proposed solution

> Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds.

## Detailed design

> Describe the design of the solution in detail. The detail in this section should be sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to reasonably implement the feature.

## Backward compatibility

> Describe how this change affects compatibility with existing community packages. Will they break? Will they produce different behavior? If "yes" to either of these, is it possible to support the old behavior alongside the new behavior? Can scripts be written in a way that they work before and after this change?

## Alternatives considered

> Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and why you chose this approach instead.
